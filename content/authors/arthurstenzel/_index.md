# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio:  I am Assistant Professor of Accounting and the University of St.Gallen. My primary areas of interest are empirical research on corporate tax and private markets. More specifically, I examine the measurement of tax avoidance, the influence of taxation on corporate innovation, and the real effects of financial accounting regulation. Other research interests include data analysis of non-financial data, e.g., textual and social media data, as well as business forecasting.
